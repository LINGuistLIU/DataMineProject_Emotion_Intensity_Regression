# DataMineProject_Emotion_Intensity_Regression

This is part of the project I did for the Data Mining course.

It is a task of emotion intensity regression, based on and using the data of the emotion intensity regression task in ["SemEval-2018 Task 1: Affect in Tweets (AIT-2018)"](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/17751).
